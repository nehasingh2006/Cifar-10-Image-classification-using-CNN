# Cifar-10-Image-classification-using-CNN
#### Problem : 
Develop a Convolutional Neural Network model by using Keras and tensorflow libraries on CIFAR-10 image dataset 

#### Dataset information : 
It consist of 60,000(32x32 pixel) color images(RGB) in 10 class. It has 6000 images in each class and it's distributed as 50,000 images as training dataset 
and 10,000 images as test dataset. The 10 classes present in datasets are :
All the images in the dataset are mutually exclusive with respect to each class, means each class will only images associated to that class category.

#### Goal : 
To build a CNN classification model with higher accuracy for CIFAR-10 image dataset.
